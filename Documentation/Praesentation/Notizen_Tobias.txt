I will show you some of the project management techniques we used in our project

-Project management
	*Kick-off Meeting
	-Define basic parameters of the project
	-such as documentation, code management

	*PSP
	-break every 
	-includes every work package of the project
	-Get a basic overview over the different milestones of the project
	-provides framework for cost estimation and guidance for schedule development and control
	
	*Gantt-Chart
	-illustrates start and finish dates of elements of a project
	-easily understood by wide audience
	-Estimate of duration of different units
	-Shows relationships of units

	*Bottom-Up
	-method used to create timeplan
	-every member of the team rates work units in regards to risk, architectural relevance
	userrelevance, developmentrelevance
	-not anonymous
	-result, especially votes that stray far from it are discussed

	*Weekly report
	-every week we had to fill out a weekly report, detailing our progress
	-showed the issues we were working on including spent time

	*Project risks
	-summarized the project risks, such as a teammember getting sick
	-not that necessary for our project, since only limited risks existed
	-+einzelner risiken durchgehen+

	*Closely working together
	-Team met each other nearly daily
	-programmed together in a room
	-open issues written on blackboard, crossed out once someone finished it -> motivation

-Outlook
	*Replacing
	-Layersystem makes it easy to replace or upgrade single components
	-makes it possible to use the base system for a long time while still being up to date
	
	*Integration remaining sections
	-There still are many sections of the hotel that act independently
	-It would be wise to embed them into our existing system
	-Easier to react to events from different sections
	
	*current website is rather basic
	-introduction of reviews or vouchers could enhance it

-Summary
	*We hope this presentation was successful in explaining the various design decisions
	our team made, and why we made them
