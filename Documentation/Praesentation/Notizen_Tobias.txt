I will show you some of the project management techniques we used in our project

-Project management
	*Kick-off Meeting
	-Define basic parameters of the project
	-such as documentation, code management

	*PSP
	-Get a basic overview over the different milestones of the project
	
	*Gantt-Chart
	-Estimate of duration of different units
	-Shows relationships of units

	*Bottom-Up
	-method used to create timeplan
	-every member of the team rates work units in regards to risk, architectural relevance
	userrelevance, developmentrelevance
	-not anonymous
	-result, especially votes that stray far from it are discussed

	*Weekly report
	-every week we had to fill out a weekly report, detailing our progress
	-showed the issues we were working on including spent time

	*Project risks
	-summarized the project risks, such as a teammember getting sick
	-not that necessary for our project, since only limited risks existed

	*Closely working together
	-Team met each other nearly daily
	-programmed together in a room

-Outlook
	*Replacing
	-Layersystem makes it easy to replace or upgrade single components
	
	*Integration of social media 
	-would be an option worth thinking about
	
	*current website is rather basic
	-introduction of reviews or vouchers could enhance it

-Summary
	*We hope this presentation was successful in explaining the various design decisions
	our team made, and why we made them
